# Professional Portfolio

## Description

This project utilizes the accumulated HTML and CSS skills learned so far to create a professional portfolio web page. The page was structured and designed to be asthetically pleasing to users while providing a brief bio and summary of work. Incorporated functionality by linking the navbar to the corresponding page section. In addition, cards were added to the work section as place holders for displaying future projects as a portfolio page. The navbar resume header was linked to a placeholder file where in the future a complete resume will be displayed.
